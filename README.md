# HerbertTestCases
Some sample test cases for Herbert

Warning for Windows users: pokemon.txt needs to have LF line endings for the scanner to work, so you can't just git clone this repo if you have autocrlf set to true, which is done by default. Downloading the repo as a git file and then unpacking it should work fine.

You'll also need to add the code in testcases.java to the ClownculatorTest.java file. The test cases should all be correct, unless I've badly mangled my code.
